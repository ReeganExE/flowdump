# FlowDump

## Summary
FlowDump is a tool for extracting payloads from packet captures. After fumbling around
with WireShark and other tools for doing this, I wanted a simple and quick solution to
get the actual UDP or TCP payloads out of a flow that was captured off the wire in a
PCAP file.

## Installation

`go get github.com/wrigby/flowdump`

... once there's code here.
